## Introduction

Graphs and equations and games, oh my! 

For our Flatiron Software Engineering Module 3 project, Kathleen Brennan, Yann Yang, and I decided to try our hand at creating a single-level graphing game. 


## Tech

This project uses a Ruby on Rails backend, JavaScript (the most vanilla) on the frontend, and includes styling from Materialize. 

## Setting Things Up

1. Clone and download this repository and the [backend](https://github.com/foxten/Mod-3-Project-Backend). 
2. In the backend directory, run `rails s` from the Command Line to start the local server. 
3. In the frontend directory, run `open index.html` from the Command Line to open a new tab in your browser. 

## How to Play

1. Choose a username and click 'Login'.
2. Click 'Start a New Game' beneath the welcome message.
3. Enter answers in teext fields provided on graph card to the right. 
4. Click 'Check' to submit your answer.
5. If correct, 'Check' button should be replaced by a 'Next' button. Click 'Next' to proceed.

### Scoring
    Players have two opportunities to submit the correct answer. 
      - If the answer is correct on the first attempt, 2 points are added to the overall score.
      - If the correct answer is submitted on the second attempt, 1 point is added to the overall score.
